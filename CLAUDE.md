This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Landing Page Development
```bash
# Navigate to landing page directory
cd landing-page/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production (creates static 'out' folder)
npm run export

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (build + add .nojekyll)
npm run deploy
```

## Architecture Overview

### Project Structure
This is a Next.js-based landing page for the OCT AI Challenge platform, configured for static export to GitHub Pages. Live at: https://emartech.github.io/oct-ai-challenge/

### Component System (Ultra-Modular)
- **landing-page/components/Hero.tsx**: Main orchestrator component with OCT AI branding, robot image, traffic flow animation (4 lanes), and Google Form integration
- **landing-page/components/ChallengeRoadmap.tsx**: Container component that combines foundation exercises and main challenges
- **landing-page/components/FoundationExercises.tsx**: Displays 7 foundation exercises with workshop indicators (green badges)
- **landing-page/components/MainChallenges.tsx**: Shows 4 main challenges with date badges (blue)
- **landing-page/components/Timeline.tsx**: Interactive milestone visualization with connected dots
- **landing-page/config/challenges.ts**: Single source of truth for all challenge content, dates, and details - update here to modify content

### Configuration Files
- **landing-page/next.config.js**: Static export configuration with GitHub Pages base path handling
- **landing-page/tailwind.config.js**: Custom OCT AI color scheme (oct-bg: #a5b2c4, oct-text: #394255)
- **.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml**: Automated GitHub Pages deployment on main branch changes

### Development Approach
- Components use TypeScript with React functional components
- Configuration-driven content management via `config/challenges.ts`
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS utility classes with glassmorphism effects
- Images are stored in `landing-page/public/` directory
- Maximum component reusability through separation of concerns

### Key Features
- Full-screen animated traffic flow using multiple lanes with different speeds
- Responsive design with 3-column grid for foundation, 2-column for main challenges
- Static site generation for optimal performance
- Automated GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions
- Google Form integration for participant registration

## Current Development Status

### Completed
- Landing page deployed and live at https://emartech.github.io/oct-ai-challenge/
- Ultra-modular component architecture with 5 focused components
- Configuration-driven content system
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Comprehensive documentation
- Participant registration via Google Forms
- **Foundation Exercises Integration**: Aligned with warmup-excercises folder structure
- **Exercise Links**: Direct GitHub links to exercise README files
- **Submission System**: Individual Google Forms for each exercise with time-based activation
- **Badge System**: Funny themed badge names as rewards (e.g., "üèì Ping Pong Champion", "ü•∑ Prompt Ninja")
- **UI Enhancements**: 
  - Full-width Timeline with darker background (bg-oct-blue/20)
  - Badge-focused exercise cards with gradient headers
  - Dual-button system (View Exercise + Submit Solution)
  - Responsive glassmorphism design throughout

### Recent Changes
- **Timeline Component**: Full-width background, rounded borders, white dots with connecting line
- **Call to Action**: Expanded to max-w-6xl to match other components
- **Foundation Exercises**: 
  - Removed workshop badges and reorganized layout
  - Badges prominently displayed at top of cards with gradient background
  - Exercise titles kept but paired with emojis
  - Submit Solution buttons active only during Oct 13-27, 2025 period
- **Config Structure**: Added submission form URLs and date ranges for exercises

### File Structure Notes
- **warmup-excercises/** folder contains actual exercise content (note the typo in folder name)
  - test/, basic/, json/, agent/, mcp-usage/, mcp-server/, prompt-injection/
  - Each has a README.md with exercise instructions
- **landing-page/config/challenges.ts**: Single source of truth for all content
  - Exercise details, badges, dates, and form URLs
  - Both foundation exercises and main challenges configured here

### Next Development Phase
1. **Update Submission Forms**: Replace placeholder Google Form URLs with actual form IDs
2. **Backend API** (challenges/backend/): Node.js server, PostgreSQL schema, authentication, challenge endpoints
3. **Frontend Dashboard** (challenges/frontend/): Participant portal, challenge interaction, progress tracking
4. **Data Integration**: Connect config to database, dynamic loading, user progress, admin interface

### Important Notes
- Edit challenge content only in `landing-page/config/challenges.ts`
- Components are designed for maximum reusability - use them individually or combined
- The platform foundation is complete and ready to scale into full challenge management system
- Submission buttons automatically activate/deactivate based on configured dates
- Badge names should remain fun and engaging to motivate participants
